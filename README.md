# Applications-of-the-frequency-domain-in-image-processing
In this project, we take the images to the frequency domain and move their spectra and phases together and finally combine them.
Then we pass the images through the Gaussian low-pass filter with different bandwidths, smooth them, and return them to the location area,
then in each case, what the low-pass filter removed once in the location area and once We display in the frequency domain
In the end, we select two different images, one through the low-pass filter and the other through the high-pass filter, and combine the result.
